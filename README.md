# NeedingACaterer-

Early career chefs and especially those who specialize in ethnic cuisine (etc. African, caribbean, Asian) often have a hard time breaking into the hospitality business. 
There are aspiring chefs who want to reach customers but don't have a platform to do so.
Chefs can post their menu/catering prices for review and order. Customers Can order from Chefs/startup restaurants per plate/per head or a set amount. i,e. pan of falafel. 
This is only for catering related or private chef orders.
